# Inundation_differences
Python codes to quantify pixel-by-pixel inundation discrepances between simulation results: 
1) Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) method
2) 2) Inundation Detector.

Before running the codes, please create a working directory and add all the data and python codes. 
For the NRMSE calculations, please create a folder named "NRMSE" within the working directory and add the unzipped folders of depth, erosion, IP, solid_frac, speed and time to avoid errors due to paths.
